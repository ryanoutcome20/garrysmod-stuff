## Usage
Basic usage is fairly simple; the script needs to be executed through menustate and run on your client. Optionally, you can just edit the menustate files themselves to get the same result since you don't need to be connected to a server to execute anything. After executing the script, simply run the console command to initiate an attack.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Command syntax is `ddos ip count` in console!

## Contribution
Unfortunately, I don't see this as a project I'm going to keep up with for long at all. It's a very simple script I made in a few minutes to test if it was even possible. If you have any issues or pull requests, then I'll see what I can do to help you.
