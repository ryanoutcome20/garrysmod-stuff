## Usage
This is a concept for a quite dangerous exploit. This would (in theory) fill someone's drive up with useless addons that aren't even mounted and won't show up in `garrysmod/data`; instead, they would fill up your addon cache located in `garrysmod/cache/workshop`. This is just a concept, and several considerations and development choices would need to be made to make this a full addon.

If you do wish to test this proof of concept, there is a basic configuration located in the file itself.
